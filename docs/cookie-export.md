# Cookie Export Guide — For Server Users

Your Agent is on a server and can't access your browser directly.
Here's how to export cookies from your local computer — **fastest method first**.

## Method 1: Cookie-Editor Extension (Recommended — 30 seconds per site)

1. Install **Cookie-Editor** for Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm
   (Also available for Firefox, Edge)

2. Go to the website (e.g. https://x.com) and make sure you're logged in

3. Click the Cookie-Editor icon in your toolbar

4. Click **Export** → **Header String**

5. Paste the result to your Agent

That's it! Your Agent will run:
```bash
agent-reach configure twitter-cookies
agent-reach configure xhs-cookies
```

Both commands use a hidden prompt. For non-interactive automation, send the
same exported value through stdin and add `--stdin`; never place cookies in
the process arguments.

Twitter values saved by Agent Reach are used by `agent-reach doctor` only to
check whether explicit credentials are present. Doctor does not run
`twitter status`. Direct `twitter` commands still require
`TWITTER_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TWITTER_CT0` in their process environment.

This XiaoHongShu export is for xiaohongshu-mcp or a legacy tool.
`agent-reach configure xhs-cookies` does not inject cookies into OpenCLI or
Chrome. OpenCLI may use only an existing Chrome session explicitly controlled
by the user. Agent Reach never logs the user in or reads XiaoHongShu browser
cookies.

### Sites to export:

| Site | URL to visit | What to tell Agent |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Twitter/X | https://x.com | "Here are my Twitter cookies: [paste]" |
| XiaoHongShu | https://www.xiaohongshu.com | "Here are my XHS cookies: [paste]" |
| Bilibili | https://www.bilibili.com | "Here are my Bilibili cookies: [paste]" |

## Method 2: Manual (No extension needed)

1. Open the site in Chrome, make sure you're logged in
2. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Click the **Network** tab
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Click any request in the list
6. In the right panel, scroll to **Request Headers**
7. Find the line starting with `Cookie:`
8. Copy the entire value after `Cookie: `
9. Paste to your Agent
